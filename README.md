Collection of Geometry Nodes and Sverchok scripts to generate quick massing models for buildings

# Intent
These scripts have been made with the intent of automating the tasks of generating the inital massing forms to be used as conceptual massing. These forms will be mainly inspired by the type of massing I generate at my work but other people are welcome to chip in their own ideas for a quick massing workflow in blender.
